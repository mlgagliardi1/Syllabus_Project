# Syllabus_Project

## Project Description
  This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to create a syllabus analysis tool. This tool can be utilized during syllabus development or to analyze a previously created syllabus. For previously created syllabuses, users can input their syllabus and obtain real-time feedback about missed sections, formatting, and other improvements. For a syllabus in development, users can compare their previous attempts to the current attempt to see how their changes have affected the efficacy of their syllabus.
