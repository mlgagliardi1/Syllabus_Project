The core directory will serve as the housing for the "backend." 
By backend I mean the spacy analysis of the document. To do this, we
first need to accomplish a few things.

    1) Determine if the input file is a PDF or txt
    2) Create a doc object of the input file


CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM CAN HANDLE .TXT, .TEXT, AND .PDF FILE EXTENSIONS.
    WILL IMPLEMENT .DOC AND .DOCX EXTENSIONS IN THE FUTURE
    SEE VALIDATORS.PY FOR LIST OF APPROVED EXTENSIONS
